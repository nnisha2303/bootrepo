                     </div>
                    <p><h6>1. Coffee Improves Physical Endurance </h6><br>
                            It’s common for athletes to consume coffee for a competitive edge. Caffeine from coffee actually has ergogenic benefits, meaning it enhances physical performance. This is great news for anyone in manual labor and sports but also for anyone doing daily housework and basic exercise.<br><br>
                         <h6>2. Coffee Protects Our Brains</h6><br>
                         The oils in coffee – kahweol and cafestol – are unique potent neurological anti-inflammatory agents that actually protect the brain against oxidative stress and DNA damage. An inflamed brain is surely a poorly functioning brain. Regular consumption of coffee can keep our brains safe from the many stressors and therefore, healthy for the long run.<br><br>
                         <h6>3. Coffee Increases Energy</h6><br>
                         It also improves lung function and oxygen intake, resulting in better metabolic efficiency. <br><br>
                         <h6>4. Coffee Increases Motor Function</h6><br>
                         While most of us know that caffeine has the overall ability to stimulate us and improve our abilities, studies show that it’s not caffeine alone that is responsible. In fact, coffee in achievable amounts has the ability to improve both our cognitive and physical motor senses.<br><br>
                         <h6>5. Coffee Increase Focus and Attention</h6><br>
                         Most of these studies have concluded that caffeine – found in coffee – increases both selective and sustained attention (maintaining focused attention over an extended period of time).<br><br>
                        <h6> 6. Coffee Increases Endurance</h6><br>
                         The studies concluded that caffeine is capable of doing this by enhancing muscle endurance, while simultaneously reducing our sense of effort commonly accompanying muscle contraction.<br><br>
                          <h6>7. Coffee Rituals Increases Creativity</h6><br>
                          Research suggests that coffee can actually help people to be more creative. A recent study shows that ambient noise and low-level sound prompts abstract thought processes. So be sure to take your coffee to the local shop or sip on your front porch — or even better, over a campfire sometime!<br><br>
                          <h6>8. Coffee Helps You Learn Things Faster</h6><br>
                          The study also found that coffee consumption leads to improved short-term memory and an increased ability to solve reason-based problems. Whether you’re learning new technology, attempting a new hobby or simply going over paperwork, coffee can give your productivity a boost.<br><br>
                          <h6>9. Coffee Blended with Butter Helps You Burn Fat</h6><br>
                          When you blend a quality fat like grass-fed butter or coconut oil – as you see in Bulletproof coffee – it breaks up what are called micelles, which helps the body to use fat for energy. Fat as a fuel source of energy provides more stability than sugar for energy. Consuming sugar as a primary source of energy can produce energy highs and lows.
